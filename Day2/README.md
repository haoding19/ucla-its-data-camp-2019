## Day 2
#### Overview
Now that we are comfortable acquiring data, we are going to spend some time learning how to wrangle it to get it into a format that is suitable for analysis. I will be introducing Python's [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) package, which is an indispensible tool for working with data in Python. We will start with some of Panda's basic operations: filtering, merging, and joining.
