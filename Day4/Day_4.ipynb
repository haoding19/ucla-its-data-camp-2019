    "This exercise is intended to summarize all that we've learned in this course. We will use the same collision data that we've become familiar with to put together a short action plan for the City's [Vision Zero](http://visionzero.lacity.org/) effort to reduce traffic fatalities. One way we can start focusing our efforts is to look for intersections that have witnessed a high number of severe and fatal injuries (also known as KSIs), and prioritize those for engineering improvements. \n",

    "Most of the Vision Zero work is focused on both severe and fatal injury. The reason we broaden the focus to severe injury is because we recognize that it is often not the characteristics of the collision, but instead the victim, that determine whether a severe injury becomes fatal. Expanding our focus to severe and fatal injuries, we also have a larger dataset to use to help identify locations for possible improvement."
